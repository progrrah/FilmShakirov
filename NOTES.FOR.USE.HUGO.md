WARNING

Using this method, there won't be any file under themes directory. In order to modify the theme, you will have to copy the file you want to modify to the same directory under layouts directory.

For example, in order to modify the themes/hugo-theme-stack/layouts/partials/header.html file, you will have to copy it to layouts/partials/header.html and modify it there (copy the code from theme's repository). The same applies to assets and static directories.
